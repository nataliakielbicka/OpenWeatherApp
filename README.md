# OpenWeatherApp
 A responsive single-page JavaScript/TypeScript application, that gets the IP address of the client, determines the client's geographic location, and displays a weather forecast for the next 3 days.
 
# Running OpenWeatherApp
 1. Download my project :)
 2. The /docs folder is only to create github pages - you can remove it.
 3. Install node.js from this official website: https://nodejs.org/en/
 4. Open cmd and in your project directory run: npm install browser-sync gulp gulp-sass gulp-rename gulp-typescript -g, so you installed all the necessary packages globally.
 5. In your project directory run npm install
 6. When everything went right, in your favourite browser you should see my app using url: localhost:3000

### App is available online: https://nataliakielbicka.github.io/OpenWeatherApp/
